glow effect kind of screwy in chrome (mostly fixed for landing page, need to fix for memory canvas page)

On landing page, file name's do not show up in under picture once the file is done uploading (-->related to buildDownloadTable function in init.js)

On memory page, pictures are not inserted from left to right in order of newest to oldest

On memory page, pictures are cropped weirdly - this fixes itself if you manually refresh the page

Not able to rename a memory

On canvas/memory page, "share" thing in the upper left hand corner is kind of weird (hard to copy the link)
