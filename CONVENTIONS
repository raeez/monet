always label a container id "_id", both in dictionaries and in variables:

  def new_func(_id, some_data):
    Memory.find_one({ "_id" : _id })

always use UNIX LF endings (as opposed to windows CRLF endings); fix this with:
    find . -type f -exec perl -pi -e 's///g' {} /;

always ensure that git's core.autocrlf is set to false:
    git config core.autocrlf false
