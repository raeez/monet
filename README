Styx environment
----------------

run `sudo ./production` from the project's root directory in order to setup your
production environment, or instead similarly run 'sudo ./dev.[ARCH]' in order to
set up a development environment.

once bootstrapped, activate your environment with '. styx/bin/activate' or
'. styx-dev/bin/activate' as appropriate. Any calls to python from within the
virtual environment will use a clean python environment contained within the
'styx/' (production mode) or 'styx-dev' (development mode).

Mythology
---------

The river styx is the boundary between heaven and hell. styx is our virtual python environment.
Gaia is the earth goddess. Gaia does nothing useful (yet).
Cerberus is the three headed dog that guards the gates of hades. cerberus implements a gateway to paymentech.
